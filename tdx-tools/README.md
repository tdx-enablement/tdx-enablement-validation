## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Intel&reg; Trust Domain Extensions(TDX)
Intel&reg; Trust Domain Extensions(TDX) refers to an Intel technology that
extends Virtual Machine Extensions(VMX) and Multi-Key Total Memory
Encryption(MK-TME) with a new kind of virtual machine guest called a Trust
Domain(TD). A TD runs in a CPU mode that protects the confidentiality of its
memory contents and its CPU state from any other software, including the hosting
Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM). Please get more details from _[TDX White Papers and Specifications](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/wiki/API-&-Specifications)_

NOTE: tdx-tools keeps evolving along with kernel version. Please refer to corresponding _[tag](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tags)_
for different kernel version support. Please make sure to use the corresponding tag aligned with kernel version.
| Tag | Kernel version | TDX Version | Descriptions |
| -- | -- | -- |
| [2022ww44](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/releases/tag/2022ww44) | 5.15    | TDX 1.0 | |
| [2023ww01](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/releases/tag/2023ww01) | 5.19    | TDX 1.0 | Performance Optimizations |
| [2023ww15](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/releases/tag/2023ww15) | 6.2     | TDX 1.5 | Live Migration |
| [2023ww22](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/releases/tag/2023ww22) | 5.19.17 | TDX 1.0 | FDE, Amber Client, IMA |
| [2023ww27](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/releases/tag/2023ww27) | 6.2.16  | TDX 1.5 | vTPM, Live Migration+ |


### 1.2 Hardware Availability

- As of July 2023, Intel TDX is available through custom `4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors` (formerly code-named “Sapphire Rapids”) delivered to certain major Cloud Service Providers, including Alibaba, Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud.  Today, Alibaba and Azure are already in preview, with Google and IBM expected in the coming months.
- Intel’s Developer Cloud will be equipped with **TDX-capable** `Intel Xeon Scalable processors` in the coming months for software testing and solution development. Stay tuned to our GitHub for news on availability.
- Intel TDX will be generally available in the upcoming `5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors` (code-named “Emerald Rapids”).

## 2. Linux Stack for Intel TDX

Linux Stack for Intel&reg; TDX is an end-to-end hypervisor cloud stack including the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and
Platform as a Service (PaaS) components.

### 2.1 Use Cases

It produce the following minimal use cases:

- Launch Intel® TDX guest VM to run general computing workloads
- Do launch-time measurement within the Intel® TDX guest VM
- Do runtime attestation with the quote generated by Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX)-based quote generation
  service (QGS) on the IaaS host

It provides the below tools for developer:

- Build individual component's package or install pre-build binaries on IaaS host or create PaaS guest image for quick evaluation
- Generate the patch set for deep dive in source code level
- Test, hack and debug the TDX technology based on [PyCloudStack](utils/pycloudstack/README.md) framework
- Dump guest VM measurement and generate TD quote report for TDX E2E attestation
- Measured boot and Secure boot for TDX guest VM

### 2.2 Components

Linux Stack for Intel&reg; TDX includes the components in below diagram:

| Name | Stack | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| TDX Kernel | Host + Guest | Linux kernel for TDX |
| TDX Qemu-KVM | Host | Qemu VMM for TDX |
| TDX SEAM Module | Host | TDX Secure Arbitration Module |
| TDX Migration | Host | Migration TD for live migration |
| [TDX Libvirt](https://github.com/intel/libvirt-tdx) | Host | The modified libvirt to create TDX guest domain via Qemu |
| [TDVF](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2) | Host | The modified OVMF(Open Source Virtual Firmware) to support TDX guest boot like page accept, TDX measurement |
| [TDX Grub2](https://github.com/intel/grub-tdx) | Guest | The modified grub for guest VM to support TDX measurement |
| [TDX shim](https://github.com/intel/shim-tdx) | Guest | The modified shim for guest VM to support TDX measurement |
