# Intel&reg; Trust Domain Extensions

Intel&reg; Trust Domain Extensions(TDX) refers to an Intel technology that extends Virtual Machine Extensions(VMX) and Multi-Key Total Memory Encryption(MK-TME) with a new kind of virtual machine guest called a Trust Domain(TD). A TD runs in a CPU mode that protects the confidentiality of its memory contents and its CPU state from any other software, including the hosting Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).
