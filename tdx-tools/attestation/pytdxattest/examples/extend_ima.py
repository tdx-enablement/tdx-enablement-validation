"""
The Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) subsystem is part of the Linux\
    Integrity subsystem and it is responsible for calculating the hashes of files\
    and programs before they are loaded, and supports reporting on the hashes and\
    validate if they adhere to a predefined list.

Most Debian distros enables IMA by default and the measurement can be found at \
    /sys/kernel/security/ima/ascii_runtime_measurements
To enable IMA in kernel for TDs, please set the kernel configs like this:
    CONFIG_INTEGRITY=y
    CONFIG_IMA=y
    CONFIG_IMA_MEASURE_PCR_IDX=10
    CONFIG_IMA_LSM_RULES=y
Also additional kernel command needed to be added for IMA enablement
    ima=on, ima_policy=tcb, ima_hash=sha384

Traditionally IMA measurements are anchored in Trusted Platform Module (TPM),\
    since vTPM is not available in TD guest. This utility can be used to anchor\
    IMA measurements into RTMR registers. Note that RTMR could only accept SHA384\
    digests.

User have to set 'ima_hash=sha384' in kernel command line while boot and is able to\
    switch the index of RTMR register to either 2 or 3 by using the flag '-i'. The\
    digests are extended into RTMR[3] by default.
