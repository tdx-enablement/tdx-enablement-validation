## Off-TD Debug

### Prepare for Debug Info

You can install `debuginfo` from the yum repository that provides the guest kernel debug info

```
sudo dnf install intel-mvp-tdx-kernel-debuginfo
```

or install the RPMs directly

```
cd <path to guest-kernel packages>
sudo dnf install intel-mvp-tdx-kernel-debuginfo-common-x86_64-<guest-kernel-version>.el8.x86_64.rpm \
intel-mvp-tdx-kernel-debuginfo-<guest-kernel-version>.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

After debug info installed, you can find debuggable modules in `/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/modules/` and sources in `/usr/src/debug/`

### Start a Debuggable TD guest

Please use the qemu command to Launch TD guest via qemu-kvm and add below parameters.

- Append `debug=on` to `tdx-guest` to turn on debugging, like

```
-object tdx-guest,id=tdx,debug=on
```

- Add `-s -S` parameter to qemu-kvm to sets GDB stub server on localhost port 1234 and wait for connection from GDB to Qemu

- Append `nokaslr` to TD kernel command line to disable kernel address randomization

After that, the qemu process starts and waits for GDB connection.

```
/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm -s -S -accel kvm -monitor telnet:127.0.0.1:9001,server,nowait -object tdx-guest,id=tdx,debug=on -append "nokaslr ..." ...
char device redirected to /dev/pts/5 (label compat_monitor0)
```

### Connect to Qemu GDB Stub

On another console, set MOD_DIR in below script and run the script to start GDB

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

GDB=gdb
MOD_DIR=/usr/lib/debug/usr/lib/modules/<guest kernel>/

$GDB \
-ex "add-auto-load-safe-path $MOD_DIR" \
-ex "file $MOD_DIR/vmlinux" \
-ex "set arch i386:x86-64:intel" \
-ex "set remotetimeout 360" \
-ex "target remote 127.0.0.1:1234"
```

Then the connection is established and GDB waits for you operation:

Please use `hb` command in GDB to set the first breakpoint, e.g. `hb start_kernel`.
Please note the software breakpoint is available after the kernel is loaded into GPA space by Qemu.
