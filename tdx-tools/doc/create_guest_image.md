## Setup TDX Guest Image

### Create EFI Cloud Image

The default cloud image for CentOS Stream does not support EFI schema, so it needs
to create customized EFI based CentOS image via [TDX Guest Image Tool](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tree/main/build/centos-stream-8/guest-image).

The tool provides scripts to generate guest image for RHEL, CentOS Stream and Ubuntu. In this section, it takes RHEL 8.5 as an example. If you want to generate CentOS Stream guest image, the steps are the same as following. The scripts for CentOS Stream is at https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tree/main/build/centos-stream-8/guest-image

For Ubuntu 22.04 guest image, please refer to https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/blob/main/build/ubuntu-22.04/README.md

### Prerequisite

- Install required packages:

  ```
  sudo dnf install -y virt-install libguestfs-tools-c
  ```

- TDX guest RPM repository was already generated by [build-repo.sh](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tree/main/build/rhel-8/build-repo.sh)

- Make sure libvirtd service and the default virbr0 interface works normal via

  ```
  systemctl status libvirtd
  ifconfig virbr0
  ```

### Install Guest Image With ISO Installer

Generate guest image td-guest-rhel-8.5.qcow2:

```
cd tdx-tools/build/rhel-8/guest-image/
./create-efi-img.sh
```

_NOTE:_

- For RHEL-8 image, please prepare RHEL 8.5 base ISO image and put it under the same directory as `create-efi-img.sh`. You can download RHEL 8.5 base ISO image from
<https://access.redhat.com/downloads>
Modify `create-efi-img.sh` and set the ISO variable to the image name as below.
Then run `create-efi-img.sh` to create the RHEL 8.5 guest image.

  ```
  ISO="RHEL-8.5.0-20211013.2-x86_64-dvd1.iso"
  ```

- For CentOS Stream image, the script will download CentOS-Stream-8-x86_64-latest-dvd1.iso (~10G) if it does not exist. Then it runs virt-install to install guest image using kickstart scripts.

### Install TDX Guest Stack into the Guest Image

Install tdx-guest-grub2, tdx-guest-shim and tdx-guest-kernel:

```
./tdx-guest-stack.sh
```

_NOTE:_

- It will copy TDX guest repo to target guest image and install the guest
packages
- Use the existing host environment in the guest. Such as /etc/environment,
/etc/chrony.conf
- This script can be used as an example of how to install necessary guest
components if a custom image is wanted.
